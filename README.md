# IIoT Attack Detection System
As the number of IIoT devices grows, so are the number of assaults on these devices. Because these attacks can ruin a company's reputation as well as create financial loss. As a result, this initiative tries to mitigate the problem by alerting users at an early stage that an attack has occurred by analyzing Network Traffic.
**This project contains two section**

>The first section simply determines whether or not an assault exists. We tested various models and determined that XGBoost was the best model for this purpose due to its high accuracy.

> The type of attack is also identified in the second part. Again, we used various models for this purpose and discovered that XGBoost was the best model for this purpose. Not only that, but we improved the accuracy of Naive Bayes with the help of the Hybrid model.
# Models
We have used Naive Bayes , Logistic Regression , XGBoost and RandomForestClassifier . We came to the conclusion that XGBoost is the best model for this purpose. Furthermore, in the second portion, we have also used a HYBRID MODEL to increase the performance of Naive Bayes.
